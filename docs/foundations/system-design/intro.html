<p>System design is the process of laying out a system’s structure, components, modules, interfaces, and data to meet specified requirements. It is a multidisciplinary field that requires a wide range of skills and knowledge, including software engineering, computer science, network engineering, and project management. From the machine learning perspective, comprehending a system’s life cycle provides a blueprint for building, deploying, and maintaining an ML/AI solution. This section will discuss the crucial aspects of system design, including requirements analysis, architecture, scaling, and system deployment.</p>
<section id="definig-the-requirements-of-the-system" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definig-the-requirements-of-the-system"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Definig the requirements of the system</h2>
<p>This is the first step in the system design process, and it involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements for the system. The requirements analysis phase is crucial, as it provides the foundation for the rest of the system design process. It helps to ensure that the system will meet the needs of its users and stakeholders and that it will be developed within the constraints of time, budget, and resources. The requirements analysis phase typically involves the following activities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Gathering Requirements</strong>: This involves collecting information about the needs, goals, and constraints of the system from its users and stakeholders. This information can be gathered through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and workshops.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyzing Requirements</strong>: This involves analyzing the gathered information to identify the key features, functions, and constraints of the system. It also involves identifying any conflicts or inconsistencies in the requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documenting Requirements</strong>: This involves documenting the requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner. The requirements should be documented in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and project managers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validating Requirements</strong>: This involves validating the requirements with the users and stakeholders to ensure that they accurately reflect their needs and goals. It also involves ensuring that the requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managing Requirements</strong>: This involves managing changes to the requirements throughout the system design process. It involves tracking changes, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that the requirements are kept up-to-date.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="types-of-requirements" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Types of Requirements</h2>
<p>There are several types of requirements that need to be considered when designing a system. These include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Functional Requirements</strong>: These are the requirements that describe the functions, features, and capabilities of the system. They specify what the system should do, and they are typically expressed as use cases, user stories, or functional specifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Functional Requirements</strong>: These are the requirements that describe the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, reliability, availability, security, and usability. They specify how well the system should perform, and they are typically expressed as performance requirements, security requirements, and usability requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Requirements</strong>: These are the requirements that describe the business goals, objectives, and constraints of the system. They specify why the system is being developed, and they are typically expressed as business cases, business rules, and business process models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Requirements</strong>: These are the requirements that describe the needs, goals, and constraints of the users of the system. They specify who will use the system, and they are typically expressed as user profiles, user scenarios, and user interface designs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>System Requirements</strong>: These are the requirements that describe the technical constraints and dependencies of the system. They specify how the system will be developed, deployed, and maintained, and they are typically expressed as system architecture, system interfaces, and system dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory Requirements</strong>: These are the requirements that describe the legal, ethical, and regulatory constraints of the system. They specify how the system should comply with laws, regulations, and standards, and they are typically expressed as compliance requirements, privacy requirements, and security requirements.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="selecting-the-appropriate-methodology" class="level2" data-number="2.3">
<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="selecting-the-appropriate-methodology"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Selecting the appropriate methodology</h2>
<p>There are several <strong>software development methodologies</strong> that can be used to develop a system, such as the waterfall model, the agile model, and the iterative model. Each of these methodologies has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they are suitable for different types of projects and teams. These methodologies also provided a framework for gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements the system.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Waterfall Model</strong>: The waterfall model is a linear and sequential software development methodology that divides the development process into distinct phases, such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin, and the process is difficult to change once it has started. The waterfall model is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and stable technologies, but it is not suitable for projects with changing requirements and emerging technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agile Model</strong>: The agile model is an iterative and incremental software development methodology that focuses on delivering working software in short iterations, typically two to four weeks. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback, and it is suitable for projects with changing requirements and emerging technologies. The agile model is based on the principles of the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterative Model</strong>: The iterative model is a software development methodology that divides the development process into small, incremental, and iterative cycles, each of which produces a working prototype of the system. The iterative model is suitable for projects with evolving requirements and complex technologies, and it is based on the principles of the spiral model, which emphasizes risk management, prototyping, and incremental development.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once we have gathered, analyzed, and documented the requirements for the system, we can move on to the next phase of the system design process, which is architecturing the system.</p>

<section id="architecturing-your-solution" class="level2" data-number="2.4">
<h2 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="architecturing-your-solution"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Architecturing your solution</h2>
<p>Architecturing a system is the act of decomposing a system into multiple building blocks so that we can identify how each building block can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently to achieve a high level of modularity, flexibility, and scalability. The architecture of a system provides a high-level view of how these components are arranged and interact with each other in order to achieve the desired functionality and performance. It also provides a blueprint for the system, which can be used to guide its development and maintenance. There are several architectural styles and patterns that can be used to design a system, including the client-server architecture, the microservices architecture, and the event-driven architecture. However, selecting the appropriate architectural style depends on the type of application to be developed. Classifying applications involves categorizing them based on criteria such as functionality, deployment methods, technology used, target user base, and platform. Here, we are providing a classification based on the deployment model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> Accessed via web browsers, e.g., Google Docs, Salesforce.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Applications:</strong> Installed on a personal computer or laptop, e.g., Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Applications:</strong> Designed for smartphones and tablets, e.g., Instagram, Uber.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Applications:</strong> Hosted on cloud services and accessible over the Internet, e.g., Dropbox, Slack.</li>
</ul>
<p>ML models can be deployed in any of these application types. For example, a web application can use a machine learning model to provide personalized recommendations to users, a desktop application can use a machine learning model to automate repetitive tasks, a mobile application can use a machine learning model to recognize speech or images, and a cloud application can use a machine learning model to analyze large datasets.</p>
<p>For web applications, cloud applications and sometimes mobile applications, the <strong>client-server architecture</strong> is a common choice for the system architecture. The client-server architecture is a distributed computing architecture that divides the system into two major components: the client and the server. The client is the end-user device or application that requests and consumes the services provided by the server. The server is the remote computer or service that provides the resources, services, and data to the client. The client-server architecture provides a scalable, flexible, and reliable way to distribute and manage resources and services across a network.This architecture consists of the following components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Client</strong>: The client is a device or a program that requests resources and services from the server. The client can be a web browser, a mobile app, or a desktop application.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Server</strong>: The server is a device or a program that provides resources and services to the client. The server can be a web server, an application server, or a database server.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network</strong>: The network is the medium through which the client and server communicate with each other. The network can be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or the internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protocol</strong>: The protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between the client and server. The protocol can be HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, or UDP.</p></li>

<h3 data-number="2.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="server-based-architectures"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Server-Based architectures</h3>
<section id="monolithic-architecture" class="level4" data-number="2.4.1.1">
<h4 data-number="2.4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monolithic-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.1</span> Monolithic Architecture</h4>
<p>The monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture that consists of a single, self-contained application that contains all the components, modules, and services of the system. The monolithic architecture is based on the principles of tight coupling, where the components of the system are tightly integrated and dependent on each other. The monolithic architecture is suitable for small to medium-sized applications with simple requirements and low complexity. It is also suitable for applications with stable technologies and well-defined requirements. The monolithic architecture consists of the following components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>User Interface</strong>: The user interface is the front-end component of the system that interacts with the user. It can be a web interface, a mobile interface, or a desktop interface.</li>
<li><strong>Business Logic</strong>: The business logic is the core component of the system that implements the business rules, processes, and workflows. It can be implemented as a set of classes, functions, or procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: The data storage is the back-end component of the system that stores and manages the data. It can be a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a file system.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: The integration is the component of the system that integrates with external systems, services, and APIs. It can be implemented as a set of connectors, adapters, or gateways.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="microservices-architecture" class="level4" data-number="2.4.1.2">
<h4 data-number="2.4.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="microservices-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1.2</span> Microservices Architecture</h4>
<p>The microservices architecture is a modern software architecture that consists of a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services that are developed, deployed, and maintained independently. The microservices architecture is based on the principles of loose coupling, where the components of the system are decoupled and independent of each other. The microservices architecture is suitable for large-scale applications with complex requirements and high complexity. It is also suitable for applications with changing requirements and emerging technologies. The microservices architecture consists of the following components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Service</strong>: The service is a small, independent, and loosely-coupled component of the system that provides a specific set of functions and capabilities. It can be implemented as a RESTful API, a message queue, or a microservice.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: The container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained environment that hosts the service. It can be implemented as a Docker container, a Kubernetes pod, or a serverless function.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong>: The orchestration is the component of the system that manages the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the services. It can be implemented as a container orchestrator, a service mesh, or a serverless platform.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong>: The gateway is the component of the system that provides a single entry point for the services. It can be implemented as an API gateway, a message broker, or a load balancer</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>: The database add to each service the capability to store and manage the data. It can be a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a distributed database.</li>
</ol>

<h3 data-number="2.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="serverless-based-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Serverless-Based Architecture</h3>
<p>With the rise of cloud computing and serverless computing, the <strong>serverless architecture</strong> has become an alternative to the client-server architecture. The serverless architecture is a cloud computing model that abstracts the infrastructure and runtime environment from the developer, allowing them to focus on writing code and deploying applications without managing servers. The serverless architecture is based on the principles of event-driven computing, where the execution of code is triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads. The serverless architecture consists of the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic architectures</strong> are best suited for small to medium-sized applications where simplicity and ease of management are key. However, they can become cumbersome to update and scale as the application grows.</li>
<li><strong>Microservices</strong> offer a highly scalable and flexible architecture that is suitable for complex applications that need to rapidly evolve. They require a significant upfront investment in design and infrastructure management but provide long-term benefits in scalability and maintainability.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless architectures</strong> abstract the management of servers, making it easier for developers to deploy code that scales automatically with demand. This model is cost-effective for applications with fluctuating workloads but introduces new challenges in managing application state and understanding cloud provider limitations.</li>

<p>Once the system has been designed and developed, it is time for our application to be shipped to a production environment. This process is known as deployment, and it involves installing, configuring, and testing the system in a production environment. It also consists of the migration of data and the training of users if needed. Deploying a system can be a complex and time-consuming process, and it requires careful planning and coordination to minimize the risk of downtime and data loss. Several deployment strategies and strategies exist. However, in today’s world, using Docker is generally the best alternative to facilitate the deployment of your system. Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that can run on any machine with the Docker runtime installed. They provide a consistent and reliable way to package and deploy applications, and they are widely compatible with cloud computing environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

<p>Docker was introduced to the world by Solomon Hykes, founder and CEO of a company called dotCloud. It provides a platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. Docker introduce the concept of “containers” to package software into isolated environments that can run on any system with the Docker engine installed. This makes it easy to run the same application in different environments, such as development, testing, and production, without worrying about dependencies, configurations, or compatibility issues.</p>

<p>Docker is written in the <code>Go programming language</code> and takes advantage of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality. The Linux kernel provides the core features and capabilities of the Docker engine, such as process isolation, resource management, and networking.</p>
<p><strong>Linux kernel features</strong> that Docker relies on include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cgroups (control groups)</strong> provide the ability to limit and prioritize the resources of containers, such as CPU, memory, and storage.</li>
<li><strong>Namespaces</strong> provide the ability to isolate and control the processes, users, and network of containers, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Union file systems</strong> provide the ability to create and manage the file systems of containers, allowing them to share and reuse the same files and directories.</li>

<p>The Linux kernel is the main component of the Linux operating system (OS). It’s a computer program that acts as the interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. The kernel manages resources as efficiently as possible and enables communication between applications and hardware.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So the question you probably have, how can Docker run containers on Windows and MacOS if Docker relies on the Linux kernel?</p>
<p><strong>On Windows</strong> you can run Docker containers using the following approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2:</strong> With the introduction of WSL 2, Docker can run Linux containers natively on Windows. WSL 2 provides a full Linux kernel built into Windows, allowing Docker to interface directly with the kernel without the need for a virtual machine (VM). This approach is efficient and integrates well with Windows environments.</p>
<p><strong>Docker Desktop for Windows:</strong> Before WSL 2, Docker Desktop for Windows used a lightweight VM to host a Linux kernel. This VM then runs the Docker Engine and, by extension, Docker containers.</p>
<p><strong>On macOS</strong>, docker also utilizes a lightweight virtual machine to run a Linux kernel. Docker Desktop for Mac leverages macOS’s native virtualization frameworks (such as Hypervisor.framework for Intel processors and the Virtualization framework for Apple silicon) to run this VM efficiently. This setup allows Docker containers to run in a Linux-like environment on Mac, with Docker Desktop handling the complexities of managing the VM.</p>

<h4 data-number="2.6.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="docker-components"><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1.2</span> Docker components</h4>
<p>Docker consists of several components that work together to provide its functionality. These components include the Docker engine, the Docker client, and the Docker registry.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Docker Engine</strong>: The Docker engine is the core component of Docker that provides the runtime environment for containers. It consists of the Docker daemon, which is responsible for building, running, and distributing containers, and the Docker runtime, which is responsible for executing the processes of containers. The Docker engine can run on any system with the Docker runtime installed, including Linux, Windows, and macOS, and it can be managed and monitored using tools and platforms, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Amazon ECS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Client</strong>: The Docker client is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows developers to interact with the Docker engine, providing a simple and intuitive way to build, run, and manage containers. The Docker client can also be used with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and integrated development environments (IDEs), providing a seamless and consistent experience for developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Registry</strong>: The Docker registry is a repository for storing and distributing containers, allowing developers to build, push, and pull containers from Docker registries, such as Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, and Google Container Registry. The Docker registry provides a high level of visibility and control over the distribution of containers, ensuring that they are secure, reliable, and efficient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Hub:</strong> This is a cloud-based repository for storing and sharing Docker Images. It provides a centralized location for developers to store and distribute their images, making it easy for others to find, download, and use them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Compose:</strong> This is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can define your application’s services, networks, and volumes in a single file, and then start and stop all services from this file.</p></li>

<p>Docker uses a client-server architecture, where the Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which is responsible for building, running, and distributing containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on <strong>the same system</strong> or on <strong>different systems</strong>, and they communicate with each other using a <strong>REST API</strong> over a Unix socket or a network interface. As it was mentioned, the Docker daemon is responsible for managing the containers, images, volumes, networks, and other resources of the system. However, it also provides a high-level API for interacting with the Docker engine, allowing developers to build, run, and manage containers using simple commands and scripts. The Docker daemon is also responsible for managing the lifecycle of containers, including creating, starting, stopping, pausing, and deleting containers, as well as managing their resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage.</p>

<p>When deploying a system, it is essential to consider how the system will scale to meet the demands of its users. Scalability describes the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work without compromising its performance, reliability, and availability. It is also related to system elasticity, which is the ability of a system to adapt to changes in the workload by adding (scaling up) or removing (scaling out) resources. Systems can be scaled in two ways: <code>vertically</code> and <code>horizontally</code>.</p>
<section id="horizontal-scaling-scaling-outin" class="level3" data-number="2.7.1">
<h3 data-number="2.7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="horizontal-scaling-scaling-outin"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In)</h3>
<p>Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines or nodes to a pool of resources to manage increased load. It’s like adding more lanes to a highway to accommodate more traffic. This approach is common in distributed systems, such as cloud computing environments, where you can add more instances or servers to handle more requests.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> It’s easier to scale applications indefinitely by simply adding more machines into the existing infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can scale the system up or down by adding or removing resources as demand changes, often automatically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Horizontal scaling can improve the reliability and availability of a system. If one node fails, others can take over, reducing the risk of system downtime.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Managing a distributed system with many nodes can be more complex, requiring sophisticated software and tools for load balancing, distributed data management, and failover mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Consistency:</strong> Ensuring data consistency across nodes can be challenging, especially in databases or systems requiring real-time synchronization.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="vertical-scaling-scaling-updown" class="level3" data-number="2.7.2">
<h3 data-number="2.7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vertical-scaling-scaling-updown"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down)</h3>
<p>Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of an existing machine or node by adding more resources to it, such as CPU, RAM, or storage. It’s akin to upgrading the engine in a car to achieve higher performance.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> It is often simpler to implement as it may require just upgrading existing hardware. It doesn’t involve the complexity of managing multiple nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Immediate Performance Boost:</strong> Upgrading hardware can provide an immediate improvement in performance for applications that can utilize the extra resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Limited Scalability:</strong> There is a physical limit to how much you can upgrade a single machine, and eventually, you might hit the maximum capacity of what a single server can handle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Downtime:</strong> Upgrading hardware might require downtime, which can be a significant drawback for systems that require high availability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost:</strong> Beyond certain points, vertical scaling can become prohibitively expensive as high-end hardware components can cost significantly more.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice between horizontal and vertical scaling depends on the specific requirements, architecture, and constraints of the system in question. Horizontal scaling is favored for applications designed for cloud environments and those requiring high availability and scalability. Vertical scaling might be chosen for applications with less demand for scalability or where simplicity and immediate performance improvement are prioritized. Often, a hybrid approach is used, combining both strategies to leverage the advantages of each.</p>
<p>Scaling your system is something you can control,and plan ahead with the support of your infrastructure team. However, doing this manually is rather time-consuming, especially when the increased load only sustains for a short period of time. In other words, you’re always too late. This is where autoscaling comes in, by automatically scaling either horizontally or vertically when the current incoming load requires it.</p>
</section>
<section id="autoscaling" class="level3" data-number="2.7.3">
<h3 data-number="2.7.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="autoscaling"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> Autoscaling</h3>
<p>Auto-scaling, or automatic scaling, is a technique that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm or a cloud environment based on the current demand. It is closely related to both horizontal and vertical scaling, but it primarily leverages horizontal scaling due to its flexibility and the ease with which resources can be added or removed in cloud-based environments. I encorage you to check the next video to understand how Kubernetes relies on autoscaling to manage the resources of your system in cloud or on-premises environments.</p>

<p>Monitoring and logging are essential for understanding the behavior and performance of a system in a production environment. It involves collecting and analyzing data about the system’s performance, availability, and reliability, while logging involves recording and storing data about the system’s activities, events, and errors. Monitoring and logging are crucial for identifying and diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring the system meets its service level objectives (SLOs) and service level agreements (SLAs). There are several tools and platforms that can be used for monitoring and logging. The selection of the appropriate tools and platforms depends on the requirements and constraints of the system.</p>
